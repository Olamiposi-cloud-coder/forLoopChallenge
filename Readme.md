# Tips Calculator Challenge

Welcome to the Tips Calculator Challenge! In this challenge, you'll be working on creating a tips calculator using JavaScript. You'll create an array of test bill values, calculate tips and totals for each bill, and then calculate the average of all the totals.

## Challenge Details

1. **Create Test Bills**: Create an array called `bills` containing 10 test bill values.

2. **Create Empty Arrays**: Create two empty arrays called `tips` and `totals` to store the calculated tips and totals respectively.

3. **Calculate Tips and Totals**: Create a `calcTip` function to calculate the tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the `bills` array using a `for` loop to perform the calculations.

4. **Calculate Average**: Create a `calcAverage` function which takes an array called `arr` as an argument. The function will calculate the average of all numbers in the parsed array. Then call this function with the `totals` array.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/Olamiposi-cloud-coder/forLoopChallenge.git

2. Open the index.js file and implement the calcTip and calcAverage functions based on the challenge details.

3. Run the code to see the calculated tips, totals, and the average total logged to the console.

## Example Output
Here's an example of how the output might look:

## yaml
Copy code
- Tips: [5, 7, 3, ...]
- Totals: [25, 37, 19, ...]
- Average Total: 30.5
